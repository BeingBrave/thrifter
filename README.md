# Thrifter

Thrifter is a location based trading platform with a simple, engaging and intuitive interface.

Thrifter is built in two parts, the app and the [api server](https://github.com/BeingBrave/thrifter-api)

## Building

Checkout the repository locally, the master branch contains stable releases and the develop branch contains the latest and greatest code (but is probably broken).

To build from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/BeingBrave/thrifter.git
cd thrifter
./gradlew
```

To import into Android Studio, clone the project then select Tools -> Android -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.

You can now build and run using the run configuration.
